	<p><strong>Limella</strong> was the concept of a social network designed to help people connect with each other, much like a dating site. This project taught me many of the design patterns I use in my day-to-day work.</p>

	<p><strong>Limella v2</strong> is designed to be a simple app the builds up a grid of your personal experiences. One important focus of this project is creating a meaningful on-boarding experience that emphasizes user privacy and security. The user experience of the first impression is the most critical in my opinion. This project is currently in development for iPhone and iPad.</p>

	<p><strong>Inferno</strong> is a simple Twitter client for iOS devices with heavy focus on minimalism. It aims to take away some of the noise that holds Twitter back from having a great user experience. Using artificial intelligence, Inferno takes your Twitter timeline and transforms it into a simple news application, showing you only what’s relevant. The main goal of this project is to see how minimal an app can be made. It is expected to be released later this year.</p>

	<p><strong>Releasify</strong> was my first iOS application and has been live on the App Store since January 2016. The idea behind this project was to go against all odds and create an application that is designed to never be opened. This unique user experience challenge proved to be successful, despite the general idea of creating applications that draw in the user’s attention as much as possible.
