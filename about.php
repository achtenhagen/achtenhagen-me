			<h4>Hello, I'm Maurice.</h4>
			<p>I'm a software engineer interested in mobile apps and autonomous vehicles. I have great attention to detail and I consider myself to be a continuous learner. Right now I am working at <a href="https://www.betterment.com/?referral_key=mauriceachtenhagen" target="_blank">Betterment</a> to help people build a more secure financial future.</p>
			<p>As a side project, I am currently building a 1:10 scale self-driving car. The goal of this project is to learn about the technology behind autonomous vehicles and how it could be applied in the real world.</p>
