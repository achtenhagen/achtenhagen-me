	<h1>About</h1>
	<img src="images/maurice.jpg" alt="Maurice Achtenhagen" />
	<p>I build iOS and web applications from the ground up. I have great attention to detail and I consider myself to be a fast learner. My deep appreciation for good user experience is the driving force for all of my projects; it is my true passion.</p>
	<p>I have been exposed to many programming languages ranging from Swift to Assembly. I would never work on a project without using version control. I am very open and adaptive to new technologies and I will always be eager to learn more! My most valuable skill is my minimalistic approach to software architecture and user interface design.<br>The best solutions are often the simplest.</p>
